#Variables

#   Rules for naming python variables:
#   1)  Start variable names using lowercase.
#   2)  NEVER start variable names with numbers, uppercase, or symbols!!
#   3)  Use descriptive names to indicate the PURPOSE of the variable.
#   4)  Variable names MUST BE a single word. Seperate "multi-word" names using an undescore (_).
