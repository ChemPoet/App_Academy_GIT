#   ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS       !! performs operator THEN updates variable value !!
#   Is / Equals             (=)
#   Add then set equal      (+=)
#   Minus then set equal    (-=)
#   Multiply then set equal (*=)
#   Divide then set equal   (/=)
#   Modulus then set equal  (%=)
#   Exponent then set equal (**=)
